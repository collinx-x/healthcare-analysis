# healthcare-analysis

The objective of this project is to design an interactive and visually appealing Healthcare Analytics Dashboard that provides actionable insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital admissions, and healthcare efficiency metrics to uncover insights on cost, patient stay duration, and condition prevalence. The dataset was cleaned and transformed in Power Query, with additional columns like "Length of Stay," "Age Group," and "Admission Month" to enrich analysis. Interactive Pivot Tables and charts were used to summarize key metrics across conditions, length of stay, and average billing. This dashboard aims to help healthcare professionals and management teams make informed decisions to improve patient care, optimize resources, and track performance trends.
**Tools Used:**
	•	Microsoft Excel power query (for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization)
	•	Pivot Tables (for data summarization)
	•	Charts and Slicers (for interactive filtering and comparison)
**Data Overview:**
The dataset used for this dashboard contains healthcare-related information, including:
	•	Patient demographics (age group, gender)
	•	Medical conditions and diseases
	•	Hospital admission details
	•	Average length of stay
	•	Medical costs and efficiency indicators
